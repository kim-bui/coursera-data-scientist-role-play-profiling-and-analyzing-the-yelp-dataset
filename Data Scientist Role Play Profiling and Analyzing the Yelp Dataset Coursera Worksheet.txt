Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
SQL code used to arrive at answer:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 distinct records for primary key 'id' of business table
ii. Hours = 1562 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of hours table
iii. Category = 2643 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of category table
iv. Attribute = 1115 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of attribute table
v. Review = 10000 distinct records for primary key 'id' of review table
		8090 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of review table
		9581 distinct records for foreign key 'user_id' of review table
vi. Checkin = 493 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of checkin table
vii. Photo = 10000 distinct records for primary key 'id' of photo table
		 6493 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of photo table
viii. Tip = 3979 distinct records for foreign key 'business_id' of tip table
		537 distinct records for foreign key 'user_id' of tip table
ix. User = 10000 distinct records for primary key 'id' of user table
x. Friend = 11 distinct records for foreign key 'user_id' of friend table

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

City: Las Vegas Category: Food
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, Sweet Ruby Jane Confections, the restaurant with 4.0 stars, is open on Saturdays from 10:00-19:00, whereas Walgreens, the restaurant with 2.5 stars, is open on Saturdays from 8:00-22:00.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, there are more reviews for Sweet Ruby Jane Confections than Walgreens. Sweet Ruby Jane Confections has 30 reviews whereas Walgreens has 6 reviews.       
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The two locations have different zip codes. Sweet Ruby Jane Confections' address is 8975 S Eastern Ave, Ste 3-B, which is in the 89123 zip code, whereas Walgreens' address is 3808 E Tropicana Ave, which is in the 89121 zip code.

SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT business.name, 
business.city, 
category.category, 
business.stars,
hours.hours,
business.review_count,
business.address,
business.postal_code
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category = 'Food'
GROUP BY business.stars;		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
There are more reviews for businesses that are open than businesses that are closed.        
         
ii. Difference 2:
Businesses that are open have an average of 3.6 stars whereas business that are closed have an average of 3.5 stars. 
                  
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
	 AVG(review_count),
	 SUM(review_count),
	 AVG(stars),
	 is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do: What is the best city to open a restaurant?
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The data I will need for this analysis are cities that have restaurants and the amount of stars each restaurant has to make comparisons. In order to determine which city is the best location for opening up a new restaurant, you will need to compare the restaurants in the city and see which restaurants are performing well and not performing so well so that you can avoid building your restaurant near a restaurant that’s in direct competition with yours in the same city. Sometimes, opening up a restaurant is all about the location.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
